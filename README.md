# Preparing-IEEE-Conference-Proceedings

Many IEEE conference organizers struggle with the preparation of conference proceedings (post-conference task). Based on my experience on preparing IEEE conference proceedings over multiple iterations, following steps are recommended. This task is to be done primarily by the Publication Chair of the Conference.


==== Steps for Publication Chair to prepare IEEE Conference Proceedings for publication on IEEE Xplore ====

0. Camera-ready Paper should be as per the IEEE template; verify that is generated by IEEE PDF eXpress

1. Copyright code on bottom left of first page of each paper

2. Obtain eCF ID for each accepted paper

3. Insert Header (conference title), insert page numbering on footer : for each paper

4. Generate Table of Contents (TOC)

5. Generate Author Index

6. Include Cover pages (title page, messages from conference chair, TPC list, organizing committee, list of reviewers)

7. Put all PDF files in one folder, follow the naming convention as specified in the PLG manual

8. Finally, use the Packing List Generator (PLG) and prepare PackingList.txt

9. Put all files (cover pages, TOC, all PDF files, author index, packing list text file) in one zip file. Zip file should be named as ConferenceRecordNumber_PartNumber.zip

10. Submit this zip file on IEEE MCE submission portal. Done!
